## File Handling

- Use PowerShell 7 for terminal commands.
- Before installing a new package, check if it's already installed:
- Use PowerShell commands to manage the project, e.g., moving and renaming files:
  Move-Item -Path .\old\path\file.txt -Destination .\new\path\newname.txt
- If unsure about the current structure or details, use PowerShell to list out necessary information:
  Get-ChildItem -Recurse
- Avoid deleting existing functionality or files without a valid reason.
- Follow the recommended folder structure and maintain organized code for scalability and readability.
